Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.","After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of \"ripping off\" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. The companies want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.","In November, Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld did include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive Pokémon Legends: Arceus.","Half a year later, Pocketpair issued an update admitting recent changes made to the game were indeed the result of the legal threats. Pocketpair confirmed that Patch v0.3.11, released in November 2024, was the result of the ongoing litigation — as players suspected. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch.","Pocketpair said that if it hadn’t made these changes to Palworld, “the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players.”","Pockeptpair revealed that last week’s Patch v0.5.5 made further changes to Palworld so that gliding is performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.","Pocketpair called these changes “compromises” the studio is being forced to make out of fear of an injunction being granted that could block the development and sale of Palworld.","Now, just a week later, modders have added the gliding back into Palworld. As spotted by Dexerto, Primarinabee’s Glider Restoration mod, available on Nexus Mods, reverses the change that came with last week’s patch.","“Palworld Patch 0.5.5? What? That didn't happen!” reads the mod description.","“For those of [you] who love flying with your pals, this mod uses sleight of hand to reverse the sleight-of-hand ‘removal’ of gliding pals,” it continues. “You still need a glider in your inventory, and it's not QUITE perfect, but it basically reverses Patch 0.5.5 without requiring you to forego future game updates.”","Primarinabee’s Glider Restoration mod was made available on May 10 and has already been downloaded hundreds of times.","As for a restoration of throw-to-release pals, there is a mod currently available along those lines, but it doesn’t work exactly as Palworld used to before last year’s patch (it doesn’t include the ball-throwing animation, rather summons the Pal where you're currently looking).","The question now is how long Glider Restoration will remain available, given the lawsuit is ongoing.","At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair.","We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He even commented a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”","Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Story details are everywhere, from traditional cutscenes, environmental details, conversations with NPCs, and yes the FromSoft classic: even buried within item descriptions. But Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different type of FromSoft game: It’s an online-driven co-op PVE game with roguelite elements. That makes it a bit difficult to deliver the usual kind of FromSoft narrative. So how is the story in Nightreign conveyed? Well, let’s talk a little bit about Remembrances. Read on and/or watch the video below.","So to start, let’s break down what the story of Nightreign even is. And who better to break that down than game director Junya Ishizaki:","“Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention – it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition. It needs something to oppose it, and that opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, who are these warriors who are entrusted with the fate of opposing and defeating the Nightlord and putting a stop to this terrible calamity.”","And that’s the setup that brings together our eight different character classes who are gathered from all across Elden RIng’s world. Nightreign’s story is more about filling in the details of who these eight characters are, what are their motivations, what was their past before having this responsibility thrust upon them to defeat the Nightlords. And to learn that, we have the Remembrances.","One of the stops the player can make at the Roundtable Hold in between matches of Nightreign is a journal in the library where you can view your current character’s Remembrances. Some of these are just journal entries that reveal a little bit of information about the character’s backstory. However, some of them are playable snippets of a moment from the character’s past. When you launch into a playable Remembrance, there will be a hazy dreamlike border around the screen, and you’ll be transported to the location of the memory.","After talking with an NPC within a Remembrance, you’ll gain a personal objective. These will differ from character to character and Remembrance to Remembrance. For some, like the Ironeye for example, your personal objective might be to launch into a match, travel to a specific marked location, and then defeat a miniboss that will only appear there if the Remembrance objective is active. Once you do, you’ll gain an item that you can bring back into the flashback, return to the NPC, and then you’ll be able to move forward to the next chapter of that character’s story.","The objectives themselves vary between classes and Remembrances. Wylder, for instance, instead of having to fight a boss, might have to find a specific item located in a cavern, which is a location you might not generally go due to the risk of being stuck there when the ring starts closing in.","Then there’s the Raider, who has a completely different style of Remembrance. He gets transported away from the Roundtable Hold and must participate in gladiatorial-like 1-on-1 battles against a variety of bosses.","It’s an interesting and very unique departure when it comes to storytelling for a FromSoft game. I personally have only gotten a small taste of these individual character storylines, but what I’ve seen and played through so far has me eager to see more once I get my hands on the full game."],"translatedText":[],"imageUrl":"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/ign-first-eldenringnightreign-4-story-blogroll-1746828641803.jpg","localImagePath":"/images/art-1747161497471-9eu0zn-article.jpg","author":"Ryan McCaffrey","pubDate":"Mon, 12 May 2025 16:00:00 +0000","postedToFacebook":false,"postedToX":false,"createdAt":"2025-05-13T18:38:17.559Z"},{"id":17,"sourceUrl":"https://www.ign.com/articles/american-dad-will-officially-return-to-fox-in-the-2026-midseason","title":"American Dad Will Officially Return to Fox in the 2026 Midseason","originalText":["It’s back, once again.

Fox One will combine news, sports, and entertainment programming into one platform, according to a press release from the network, and will include both live streaming and on demand access to the full catalog of Fox brands, including the option to bundle with Fox Nation within one platform.","American Dad does not yet have a premiere date for its Fox resurgence, but no matter what, we’ll be watching (and singing that theme song). And it seems it will probably be available on Fox One at that point too, but we'll know for sure sometime next year.","Photo by Frederick M.

Between Destined Rivals preorders vanishing in seconds, new split expansion sets in Black Bolt and White Flare, and Journey Together chase cards dominating every feed, Pokémon TCG has never felt more intense.","If you're trying to keep up with Pokémon TCG without getting ripped off or left behind, here's where to start, including the latest update on what can be bought here and now from trusted retailers in the US.","If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. One surprise best seller has dropped in price, and an in-demand Elite Trainer box is back.","All the products featured above are sold and shipped by Amazon, and there's some cool products in here including changes at Sword and Shield era chase cards in the Infernape V box, Mimikyu ex Box and obviously Astral Radiance booster packs.","Just watch out for pricing that's over MSRP, as we Pokémon trainers are in a weird spot right now, so don't pay more than what you want to, or consider buying single cards instead of gambling on overpriced ETBs. Whatever you decide, make sure you're having fun!","Trying to buy Pokémon cards at retail prices these days feels more like a boss battle than a shopping trip. Between lightning-fast sellouts, sneaky price hikes, and listings that vanish before you’ve even opened your browser, finding a good deal can be frustrating.","I’ve spent way too much time bouncing between sites, chasing restocks, and narrowly dodging scalpers. But after enough trial, error, and a few accidental overpays, I’ve figured out where the odds are at least somewhat in your favor.","I think TCGPlayer is the smartest place to spend money if you know what cards you're chasing. Instead of rolling the dice on booster packs, you can just go buy the singles you want, or even check out other regions sets like Japan's Glory of Team Rocket.","It’s also where I go to check actual card values instead of relying on whatever price Amazon randomly assigns. There are deals to be had, you just have to be willing to search a bit. It’s Pokémon eBay, but cleaner.","Pokémon TCG’s next big release, Destined Rivals, arrives May 30, and I’m already prepping my shelf space and emotionally budgeting like I won’t blow it all on an Elite Trainer Box I absolutely do not need.","This set brings back Trainer’s Pokémon, reintroduces Team Rocket for another round of villainous fun, and includes some of the best card art we’ve seen in ages. If you're into flashy collectibles or just enjoy the feeling of cardboard power coursing through your veins, this one's for you.","Preorders are currently out of stock everywhere at the time of writing, but it's worth bookmarking the relevant listings and checking back daily this week for more updates, as we're expecting even more stock drops between now and release day.","The Pokémon Company recently announced a new split expansion for the Pokémon TCG, continuing the Scarlet & Violet series. Titled Scarlet & Violet: Black Bolt and Scarlet & Violet: White Flare, both expansions will release on July 18, 2025, at participating retailers worldwide.","Preorders have started to go live, which we've been covering, but it'll be a hard fought battle so ensure you're already bookmarking the listings below and checking out IGN's dedicated Black Bolt and White Flare preorder guide for more updates.","Latest Update: The Pokémon Center and Best Buy kicked things off last week, while Amazon's listings are up but not live yet. Stayed tuned for more, and follow @IGNDeals to be kept in the loop.","The expansions focus on the 156 Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region. Each Unova Pokémon will appear as either an illustration rare or a special illustration rare card, with different versions available in Black Bolt and White Flare products.","Another week, another hectic shift in the Pokémon single card market watch whilst trainers are waiting for Destined Rivals to drop.","Whilst we're finally seeing a noticeable climb in Sword and Shield era Pokémon Cards, Scarlet and Violet series cards are settling back down into the realm of reality for the most part.","The most dramatic crash this week is Greninja ex 214/167, crashing by nearly half when compared the the start of this year. We're also seeing some nice price drops across Obsidian Flames and the elusive 151 expansions.","Meanwhile, Dragonite V from Evolving Skies is doing the opposite, nearly doubling in value compared to the start of this year, and the artwork alone always made this card undervalued. Charizard V Alt Art is also a banger, depicting a Pokémon battle against Venusaur whilst slowly climbing up in value.","Moving onto this weeks climbers, Rayquazza VMAX alt art is one of the main grails of the Sword and Shield era. It was already a $500+ card, but at $649.99 it shows no signs of slowing down. This could arguably hit the $1,000 mark in a few years, so I'd get one if you can afford it.","There can't be enough Kanto love in my book, and Charizard V Alt Art smashes it out of the park with this Venusaur battle. The angle is great and it feels like a moving card instead of a static body shot so many Pokémon cards are guilty of (Looking at you, WotC era). It's earned another $40 since January, and there's no reason why this card can't get over $200 before the year is out.","Did you miss last week's top climbers and crashers? Catch up in our dedicated article, and stay locked in for more updates.","What was once a post-Scarlet & Violet cooldown has turned into another full-blown Pokémania, and whether you're hunting sealed product, singles, or ETBs, knowing where to shop is half the battle.","To help you on your quest, we’ve rounded up all the best places to buy Pokémon cards right now in 2025, from trusted online stores to physical retailers that still stock the good stuff. While plenty will currently be out of stock, consider this your one stop shop to find all the links you'll ever need for each set.","Released March 28, 2025. Journey Together brought back nostalgic Trainer’s Pokémon cards from the Gym Heroes era. N’s Zoroark ex and Lillie’s Clefairy ex end the chaos of endless secret arts for a more curated, collectible experience.","With just 16 Pokémon ex, 11 illustration rares, and three hyper rare gold cards, it’s easier to track what’s worth pulling without feeling like you need a PhD in pack odds. Fancy snagging the Enhanced Booster Display Box with its bonus N’s Reshiram illustration rare or pull Iono’s Bellibolt ex? This set screams nostalgia with a new coat of paint.","Journey Together - Top 10 Single Cards","Released January 17, 2025. Prismatic Evolutions kicked off 2025, and it’s all about Eevee and its many evolutions. You won’t find these cards in the usual booster packs. Instead, they’ll be released in boxed sets throughout the year, each packed full of exclusive cards celebrating Eevee and friends.","With over 175 cards, including unique designs and new game mechanics, Prismatic Evolutions is shaping to be a hit with collectors and competitive players alike.","Prismatic Evolutions - Top 10 Single Cards","The fandom is down to just being happy that they can find any Pokémon TCG stock at MSRP as it stands, making the hobby look a bit bleak. But with world events being what they are, it's given investors and collectors itchy feet with their stacks of ETBs and sealed product from these sets.","If you’re ever not sure what something should cost, here’s the list to follow. These are the standard MSRPs to go by when deciding if a product is worth picking up.","Pokémon TCG MSRP Guide (as of May 2025)","Booster packs and bundles","Elite Trainer Boxes","Premium collections","Tins and boxes","Preconstructed decks","Booster boxes","This is the time for trainers who just love the hobby to keep an eye on single card prices, as the market does seem to be rectifying itself from the months of inflated prices we've seen.","Whilst it's not quite time to jump on high ticket Pokémon cards just yet, it's a great time to snap up some beautiful cards that are slept on.","Take the promo card from the Scarlet and Violet Paldea Evolved Elite Trainer Box. The ETB is currently going for around $75 at the time of writing, but the included promo card can be snapped up for south of $10.","Even factoring in the Paldea Evolved Booster Packs that are getting hard to find, it makes sense to pick this beautiful promo card up now whilst it's still cheap.","It's also worth considering the Pokémon Center exclusive version of this card that's stamped and included in the Pokémon Center Exclusive Paldea Evolved ETB.","The ETB is currently going for around $275 sealed, with the promo currently going for around $70 in bad condition. It's not about going for the ridiculously priced Pokémon TCG products, it's about snapping up what people aren't focused on.","The artwork that Scarlet and Violet / Sword and Shield sets put out on their SIR, AR and IRs are absolutely stunning. I would put solid money on these cards becoming valuable parts of a collection in years to come. Plus, they're awesome to get graded and have in your collection cabinet or shelf.","There are two main reasons for stock shortages in 2025: Scalpers and print runs. The Pokémon Company has told us on a number of occasions over the years that they're upping print runs of in-demand sets to meet demand, and (eventually) the market gets flooded.","Just think, those ridiculously priced Evolving Skies booster boxes on TCG Player were a dime a dozen at one point. The scalper situation is going to happen whenever there's an in-demand product, and it's not very fair on real trainers who just want to collect and play Pokémon for the love of the hobby.","The crypto-turned investor bros aren't helping either, but give someone an opportunity to turn $1 into $5 and they'll do it.","This doesn't mean I condone any of this behaviour, far from it, but retailers should and need to do more to ensure everyone has a fair shot at buying Pokémon TCG. Loyalty and member drops, \"X\" amount per household, invitation-based preorders and re-stocks are all solid way's to control Pokémania.","The problem is only a few retailers are doing this, making it easy for scalpers and bot groups to snap up stock. Retailers such as Costco seem quite happy to let chaos ensue as human beings fight each other for bits of cardboard. Common sense doesn't float with these kinds of people, so restraints and control need to be put into place.","If retailers started implimenting these measures and TPC begin to flood the market with enough product for everyone to enjoy, it would make a more accessible hobby for everyone. For collectors, values of legacy chase cards would eventually climb as sealed stock goes out of print anyway, everyone wins. Well, bar the scalpers, but screw 'em.","Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

As you’d expect, the internet captured the trailer, which we expect will be released officially soon.","The Complete Edition includes the base game and all the DLC released so far for both PS5 and PC. The news comes over a year after Stellar Blade’s successful April 2024 launch on PS5.","Stellar Blade has all the features you’d expect on PC, including AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.","Elsewhere, the trailer reveals a new boss battle vs Mann, Leader of the Sentinels, and 25 new costumes, which we presume will also be made available on PS5. Players have also noticed that, at the end of the trailer, Eve lets go of a memory stick — a sequence that isn't in the base game. Some are now speculating Stellar Blade is set for a new ending or maybe even DLC.","Stellar Blade was a big hit for Korean developer Shift Up, bringing in $43 million in royalties in its last financial year. It expects the PC version to outsell the PS5 version, which sold more than 1 million copies in two months. Shift Up has said it's considering making another game in the franchise, too.","Stellar Blade sees players take on the role of Eve as she battles against unknown invaders to reclaim Earth in fast paced action role-playing game combat. It earned a 7/10 in IGN's review and proved popular otherwise, quickly selling a million copies.","\"Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre,\" we said.","Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Patch 01.003.000 is out now across PC and PlayStation 5.","Following a number of teases from developer Arrowhead, Helldivers 2 has unleashed a new invasion push from the Illuminate alien faction. This brings with it new enemies, as detailed on the PlayStation Blog, including the Stingray (jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs), and the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover.","There’s also the Fleshmob, which is described as a “failed” Illuminate experiment: “a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.”","Arrowhead teased “sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities.” So perhaps there will be more for players to discover once they jump into the game.","Meanwhile, Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression for the first time. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons.","Here’s the official blurb:","Arrowhead has also unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on the Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. This backlog of patterns unlock on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond.","And finally, the Superstore has been changed so items you want are always available, as opposed to players having to wait for items to come back into rotation.","Outside new features, patch 01.003.000 brings with it an extensive balance pass, with changes to spread, drag, sway, melee weapons stamina cost, shrapnel spawning, and fire damage. Check out the patch notes in full below.","Weapon Customization Gear up, Helldivers — your arsenal just got personal! With the new Weapon Customization system, you can now tailor your favorite weapons to match your combat style and preferences once you’ve progressed and unlocked different attachments. Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting underbarrels for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield.","Tinker in the menu, customize your specific weapon configs and switch between them during the mission loadout sequence.","It's time to fight for Super Earth with weapons that are truly yours!","We are aware of a bug that prevents players from canceling customization with a controller. We have a fix identified and prepared for our next hotfix. In the meantime, you can save the customization and then go in and do it again.","**Stingray: ** Jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs. **Crescent Overseer: ** Has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover. Fleshmob: A failed Illuminate experiment made up of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.","Weapon balances:","Spread: Spread refers to how much a projectile veers from the point you're aiming at when you fire. This rebalance primarily targets SMGs and sidearms, which previously had noticeably higher spread values. We've reviewed all primary, sidearm, and support weapons with the intent to significantly reduce spread overall, as it didn’t make much sense for these specific weapons to have such high inaccuracy.","Drag: Drag determines how quickly a projectile loses speed over distance, affecting its damage. We've increased drag for pistol-caliber ammunition (used in SMGs and some sidearms) to better represent its shorter, wider projectile compared to rifle rounds. As a result, these weapons will be slightly less effective at longer ranges.","Sway: Sway refers to how much the weapon's aim shifts, influenced by factors like movement and stance. It represents the weapon's inertia and stability—so weapons with lower ergonomics will experience less sway, while those with higher ergonomics will have more. Sidearms will naturally have more sway than primaries due to the lack of support features like stocks. This balance patch specifically focuses on adjusting sway for primaries and sidearms.","Stamina Cost: All melee weapons now consume less stamina when attacking, reducing the cost from 0.1 to 0.05. This change makes melee combat less punishing and allows for easier repositioning between strikes. The affected weapons include the CQC-30 Stun Baton, CQC-19 Stun Lance, CQC-5 Combat Hatchet, and the Entrenchment Tool.","Shrapnel spawning: With this update, shrapnel will now always spawn in a full 360-degree spread, regardless of where the explosion occurs. This means weapons like the R-36 Eruptor will now more reliably hit the intended target with their shrapnel. In addition, we’ve adjusted shrapnel performance against armor. Shrapnel now has reduced effectiveness at poor impact angles, to reflect its lack of design for armor penetration in such situations. These shrapnel balance changes will impact the following weapons:","Balance Changes: Armor Penetration decreased on shrapnel projectiles from 3-3-3-0 to 3-3-2-0","Frag Grenade","Autocannon Flak","Fire and Flamethrowers: This update aims to better balance fire damage between direct hits (like those from flamethrowers) and burn effects over time, while also introducing scaling of fire damage depending on the size of the enemy. Previously, burn damage didn’t scale well against larger enemies, making putting them on fire feel less effective in those encounters.","Now, the larger the enemy, the more damage they take while burning. However, bigger enemies will also be slightly more resistant to ignition. Additionally, direct fire damage now scales with enemy size—so large enemies like Chargers will still take roughly the same damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less.","We have also increased the magazine capacity of the FLAM-66 Torcher and the FLAM-40 Flamethrower because putting stuff on fire is fun!","Damage","Time to ignite","The Helldiver","AR-23 Liberator","AR-23P Liberator Penetrator","AR-23C Liberator Concussive","StA-52 Assault Rifle","AR-23A Liberator Carbine","AR-61 Tenderizer","SMG-37 Defender","SMG-72 Pummeler","MP-98 Knight","StA-11 SMG","SMG-32 Reprimand","JAR-5 Dominator","R-63CS Diligence Counter Sniper","FLAM-66 Torcher","R-36 Eruptor","PLAS-39 Accelerator Rifle","GP-31 Ultimatum","**The intent with these changes: **","P-2 Peacemaker","P-19 Redeemer","P-113 Verdict","PLAS-15 Loyalist","LAS-58 Talon","P-72 Crisper","GP-31 Grenade Pistol","LAS-7 Dagger","P-11 Stim Pistol","SG-22 Bushwhacker","P-4 Senator","Crash Fixes, Hangs and Soft-locks:","Weapons and Stratagems","Missions","Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Tez2 suggested a GTA 4 port for modern systems may be released this year, and its existence was part of the reason Rockstar recently had a GTA 5 Liberty City Mod shut down.","However, it’s worth stressing that Rockstar has made no indication it plans to re-release GTA 4, and in truth such a game would come as a huge surprise, given the studio's ongoing focus on GTA 6.","Obbe Vermeij, former Rockstar Games technical director who worked at the company from 1995 to 2009, was asked about the GTA 4 rumors on social media. While he hadn’t heard about them, he did say GTA 4, which he worked on, “should be remastered.”","“It's a great game and there have been a number of successful remasters recently,” he added, perhaps referring to the hugely popular The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.","“I would like to see it updated,” Vermeij continued in another social media post. “Niko is still the best protagonist in any GTA game I think.”","As for how this potential remaster might work, Vermeij suggested Rockstar would perhaps port GTA 4 to the latest version of the Rage engine, which it uses to build its games.","Again, it’s worth pointing out that Rockstar has provided fans with no indication it plans to remaster GTA 4. We should remember the enormous undertaking that is GTA 6, and to take on a GTA 4 remaster or remake amid all that would perhaps be beyond the scope of Rockstar, even with its seemingly endless resources.","Rockstar could have an external studio handle the port, as it did with the port of Red Dead Redemption, but the timing of a GTA 4 re-release in 2025 makes little sense when you think about GTA 6’s initial fall 2025 release window. If GTA 6 were not delayed, it’s doubtful Rockstar would sell a GTA 4 remaster and GTA 6 in the same window, diverting the audience's attention away from the main event.","Sticking with Liberty City, some GTA fans think the location may end up in GTA 6 either at launch or as post-launch DLC.","Liberty City is the GTA series’ take on New York City, and was the setting for 2008’s GTA 4 as well as 2009 spin-off GTA: Chinatown Wars. GTA 6 is set in the fictional state of Leonida (Florida), which includes Vice City, GTA’s take on Miami.","While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including all the details we’ve discovered so far, a roundup of 70 brand new screenshots, and the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro.","Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

If you link your browser GeoGuessr account to your Steam one, you cannot unlink it, nor can you log out of the Steam version. You cannot play alone, not even to practise and improve. The free amateur mode seems to be full of bots rather than real-life players. And perhaps most surprisingly of all, even if you pay to unlock the features on the browser version, this does not carry over to Steam.","In its defense, GeoGuessr does make this clear — in its FAQs, the developer states \"having a GeoGuessr browser subscription does not grant you full access to the GeoGuessr Steam Edition, unless you have an Elite Yearly subscription\" — and unlike the browser edition, which requires an annual payment, the Steam Edition Steam Pass is a \"one-time purchase giving you access to the full game for the year.\" It is also clearly marked as an early access title, so it can refine the gameplay, introduce new features, \"and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players.\"","However, it's clear from both the Steam discussion forums and GeoGuessr's subreddit that the monetization model and lack of features has really taken players by surprise.","Though sold as free-to-play, GeoGuessr Steam arguably offers less than an hour's free content (that's how long it took us to complete it), hosts just one mode, Duels (wherein you ostensibly face-off against another human player), and lets you play in just one league: Amateur Division. That's it. Without paying for the $2.50 monthly subscription — which does not bill monthly but instead requires a $30 upfront one-off payment — you cannot access higher ranks. There are no other modes at all at this time.","To be clear, GeoGuessr's browser game is not free, either. While you can play three rounds a day for free, to unlock all modes, you need to subscribe to one of three premium tiers: Pro Basic at $2.49 a month, Pro Unlimited's $2.99pm, or Pro Elite's $4.99pm. Only the latter two include free access to the Steam game.","In an exclusive statement to IGN, GeoGuessr said it was \"excited to have a first version of our game available on Steam, something that has been highly requested by our community for a long time.\" It said that the Steam rollout \"align[ed] with its vision of letting everyone explore the world, regardless of their preferred platform,\" adding: \"Bringing the game to Steam offers some great new possibilities, like connecting with Steam friends, enabling additional anti-cheat functionality, and so on.\"","That anti-cheat functionality is hugely important to the GeoGuessr community, too. The browser game has long been plagued by cheaters using exploits, bots, or good 'ole Google, despite it clearly being against the community rules, so it's possible the developers hopes to lean on Steam's architecture to help combat pervasive cheating.","\"This is a major milestone for us, and also just the beginning,\" explained head of marketing, Tomas Jonson. \"The game is currently in Early Access, and we’re committed to expanding and improving both the free and paid experiences over time. Much of the feedback so far has been around the monetization of the game, with many wishing for a one-time purchase model.\"","The developer said that as GeoGuessr relies on data from Google Street View, \"where the costs for street view are ongoing and tied to the number of games played,\" it based the Steam edition \"on a model similar to what we use in the browser game.\"","\"The main exception that the Steam Pass is a non-recurring yearly purchase,\" Jonson pointed out.","GeoGuessr suggests the Steam version will be in early access for \"at least six months\", and it will \"introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players.\" It also states on its Steam page that it aims to \"expand\" the Steam game with \"new modes, maps, and competitive features.\"","\"We really appreciate the high engagement and all the player feedback we have received so far. We’ll continue listening closely and working with the community as we further develop the Steam Edition,\" Jonson concluded.","Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

Eventually the call was made to pivot and exclusively focus on the wrong side of the law, because it was decided being a criminal was way more fun than being a boring old cop. GTA as we know it was born and, a bazillion in sales later, it’s hard to argue they made the wrong decision. However, nearly three decades down the track, The Precinct has arrived to remind us that there actually is a way to make upholding the law just as engaging as breaking it, in an old school, GTA-inspired sandbox city. The Precinct may be a modestly sized package overall – and the crime-busting gameplay loops it throws at us do eventually become a little samey and worn over its roughly 12-hour campaign – but its isometric, grimy ’80s aesthetic is absolutely excellent and there’s real novelty in patrolling the rain-slick streets, seeking to chip away at Averno City’s neverending supply of miscreants, mobsters, and malefactors.","Setting The Precinct in the ’80s is the single best decision developer Fallen Tree Games has made here. There’s no cyber crime, social media, or mobile phone nonsense cluttering up proceedings. Rather, it’s a world detached from all manner of modern crap; it’s just you, your partner, and a radio. The Precinct is nothing if not an earnest and distinctly 20th century cops ’n’ robbers playground, and it’s all the better for it – it’s like an old TV show. I feel like my CD collection would probably make it clear I understand that police accountability is not a new debate by any stretch but, hey, even Henry Rollins found a way to go from spraying cops with Black Flag lyrics to playing cops in The Chase and Bad Boys II. The Precinct just wants to let us screech in, sirens blazing, and save the day. This is not a game that attempts to grapple with controversy, or the seedier side of ’80s policing – it’s an idealised portrayal of cops and how they’re supposed to properly protect and serve, rather than a commentary on how they actually do it.","At its core, it’s an action-packed ode to iconic 1980s police procedurals and movies; every day would be the busiest and most dangerous day of any actual cop’s career, baddies are cuffed and booked without delay, and the city will never run out of squad cars, no matter how many you destroy. No one would realistically continue to live in The Precinct’s Averno City by choice – it’s chaos. It’d be like living in the last 15 minutes of The Blues Brothers every hour of every day, as countless squad cars crash through crumbling concrete in their relentless pursuits of the city’s brazen crooks. The cop fiction cliches are certainly all here – you can check off the young, idealistic rookie partnered with a jaded veteran counting the weeks until his retirement, a moustachioed chief, and an officer named Kowalski.","I do wish the script had a bit more of a natural, spoken-word flow to it, though. As it stands it tends to sound a little overwritten and hammy, and some of the voice acting comes over a bit corny as a result. If The Precinct really was a TV show, it unfortunately wouldn’t be in line for any of Hill Street Blues’ 26 Emmys.","Fortunately the hokey dialogue does little to detract from what it gets right, and I was very quickly hooked into its cadence of daily shifts on the beat. These can be pounding the pavement on foot, with your eyes peeled for vandals and violence. They can be cruising the streets, prowling for carjackers, or watching for the telltale weaving of a drunk driver. They can even be aerial missions where you’re hovering above the city in a chopper, catching crooks in your spotlight and calling in backup to effect arrests.","There’s a great amount of variety in the types of crimes being committed, which is unfortunate for Averno City’s victimised citizens, but good for us as the emergent missions essentially never stop. I did eventually reach a point where the busts began to feel a little repetitive, but this wasn’t until I was quite close to the end of the roughly 12 hours I spent completing the core story. The procedural street crimes continue after the credits roll, but I suspect I’ll leave The Precinct sweating in the interrogation room for now, and come back to it later if it has anything further to offer me down the track – like fresh cases or different street crimes in a potential future update.","The action occurs both on foot and in vehicles so, whenever you’re not airborne over the city, a typical shift will involve hoofing it after some suspects before tackling and subduing them – and high-speed, paint-trading car chases to catch others. Those car chases are terrific thanks to The Precinct’s strong handling model. Vehicles may appear cute and toy-like on screen thanks to the elevated, isometric camera angle, but they’re not sticky or twitchy. They have a really well-honed sense of weight as you hurl their all-American bulk into handbrake turns to negotiate corners. When a gaggle of squad cars with sirens blazing close in on a fleeing perp all at once, there are times when The Precinct reminds me more of the original Driver than the old 2D GTA games. (The original Driver as viewed from a low-flying drone, that is.)","The range of era-correct lookalike vehicles is spot-on, too, from off-brand Mustangs and ’Cudas, to A-Team-adjacent Vanduras, and the classic, boxy third-gen Caprice cop cars I’ve seen Hollywood crash a thousand of over the years. It’s Detroit steel as far as the eye can see. I love the visual style, with subtle outlines on the vehicles that give them an almost illustrated look. Sirens are especially snazzy at night too, casting a soft blue and red glow on the slick streets. It’s a great looking game overall, and there’s a lot of granular detail that’s been baked into the environment – from heavily vandalised phone booths to the signage for slimy strip clubs. The level of care is admirable considering the distant camera perspective makes it hard to notice these finer touches while bombing through the map in a battered patrol car, but I was able to appreciate them after slowing down to better absorb the surroundings. Regardless of whether I was playing slowly or recklessly, The Precinct ran reliably for me throughout testing with no crashes.","The Precinct places a clear focus on following correct procedure, and you’ll earn fewer experience points if you make errors or stray from the rules. This will mean levelling up delays and slower access to the upgrade trees if you go rogue and accost people before checking their ID, attack civilians, use inappropriate force on perps, or issue bogus parking tickets. You won’t lose XP from your previously banked total, but being a bad cop will wipe out your daily gains. Most of the upgrades are fairly typical – resilience to attacks, greater ammo capacity, and the like – but naturally it pays to have as many as you can when you find yourself in a shootout. The abilities to call in heavy-duty riot vans and roadblocks are definitely useful in helping end pursuits, too.","It’s an interesting approach, and it’s one you can go quite deep with if you really want to take control of which individual charges you’re booking your suspects with, and escort them personally to the station (which will earn you more XP). This part of the process can be automated, however, and that’s what I opted to do on almost all occasions, in order to keep things moving along. I’d rather be out on the streets than riding a desk doing paperwork.","However, most arrests generally do unfold the same way: you ID your suspect, search them for weapons and contraband, and then arrest them, fine them, or let them go. It’s a system that wears a bit thin by the story’s conclusion because there aren’t enough variables or surprises to separate one from the next. It’s also always a little unsatisfying when it seems to misread the situation, such as when some scumbag is trying to run me over with their car and it scolds me for using my gun to defend myself. I’m a loose cannon, goddamnit! At least let me charge them with trying to kill me.","I’m not certain whether this sort of thing is a bug or just something that hasn’t been accounted for, but The Precinct is a little janky overall. I didn’t face any game-breaking issues, but I did encounter the odd gravity-defying fling and unexplained invisible wall that broke the illusion."],"translatedText":[],"imageUrl":"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/precinct-blogroll-1747133402021.jpg","localImagePath":"/images/art-1747161494526-rc9343-article.jpg","author":"Luke Reilly","pubDate":"Tue, 13 May 2025 13:00:00 +0000","postedToFacebook":false,"postedToX":false,"createdAt":"2025-05-13T18:38:14.625Z"},{"id":9,"sourceUrl":"https://www.ign.com/articles/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-to-2026","title":"Amy Hennig's Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra Delayed to 2026","originalText":["Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is delayed out of 2025 to early 2026.","A statement published by Skydance Games confirmed the delay, with the development team working to add polish.

We see the books slowly fall and knock the following book in a satisfying fashion.","Muaxh03 said they did not use mods to place the books, rather placed them one by one, which sounds particularly grueling. They admit to spawning the books, however. The entire process took seven hours.","“... almost every time I loaded the save something broke, it was not reliable so yes I had to deal with books falling or glitching most of the time, that's why you can see some desynchronizing on the books, some fall slower or faster,” Muaxh03 explained.","NPCs were disabled, of course: “I would lose my mind if there was NPCs walking around,” Muaxh03 said.","While this effort is a good start for Oblivion Remastered Dominoes, previous efforts in past Bethesda games were more elaborate and involved varied objects. But playing around with books in Oblivion, even Oblivion Remastered, is a lot harder than you might think because you can’t rotate and place objects in Oblivion in the same way you can in Starfield or Skyrim.","“I spent the first 1-2 hours trying to learn how to place them good, after that the stairs took 2-3 hours because every time I tested it, it gave me different results, every time I loaded the save something broke,” Muaxh03 said.","Reaction from Oblivion players has been universally positive, with a mix of disbelief at the time, effort, and patience that went into placing the books so precisely in a game as fiddly as Oblivion.","What next? “Cool now fill a bookcase!” joked one player. “I would sooner fight a god in hand-to-hand combat unarmed. Last time I tried to put a book back the whole room ended up in shambles — SHAMBLES!”","Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake.

That’s not inherently a bad thing, but Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade commits the cardinal sin of not bolstering the droll byproduct of doing the same thing over and over again with compelling meta-progression or hiding it under an interesting story delivered by characters you can’t wait to hear from. Instead, its few attempts at drama and humor miss more than hit, and its decent combat and interesting weapons are let down by room after room of weak monsters and weaker level design.","The “legends” part of the title is literal, with the story of Yasha told and retold across three campaigns with different playable protagonists. Each tale remixes the roles of some key characters, almost akin to a theatre troupe that puts on multiple shows with the same small cast. Old man Gengo goes from village elder to adoptive father to benevolent king across the three stories, for example. This idea is maybe the most interesting thing about these stories, though. They are otherwise filled to the brim with some well-worn tropes, like the chosen one whose past is shrouded in mystery or the good soldier just looking to uphold the honor of their patron in the face of certain annihilation. The problem isn’t simply that they aren't super original – reused structure can still make for entertaining fiction. It's that all three are packed with just as much (or more) banal writing as they are with any compelling dialogue. Underwhelming moments of self reflection and bad attempts at humor quickly overstay their welcome in a trio of tales that try and fail to be moving and meaningful.","The structure of Yasha doesn't help deliver the story very well, either. It attempts the Hades-like approach of weaving conversations between boss fights at the end of each dungeon run’s three stages, but produces neither memorable moments between the chosen characters and their enemies nor good, or even coherent, reasons to continue down the path. Finishing a run changes the chapter, and everything is done all over again with almost no changes to the structure. In between trips through the gauntlet, the village full of people you are supposedly fighting to protect features a good amount of townsfolk to talk to and not a single one with anything interesting to say. The rinse and repeat nature of it all does the already mid story no favors.","For their own reasons, each hero takes off on a journey in pursuit of the dastardly Fox Demon, who's been spreading his dark influence and causing chaos throughout the land. These journeys take them chopping and shooting their way through the same three locations: a crab infested beach, a forest full of demons and angry wildlife, and a frigid castle stuffed with enemy soldiers, all with loot to collect along the way. Runs themselves are largely static and predictable as stage layouts, enemy variety, and spawn patterns remain largely the same for every trip through the dungeon. Monsters may be slightly stronger and rooms are shaped differently when you reach the next chapter, but that’s about it.","These areas are pretty, but aren’t very dynamic, and only the last castle region has features in it like destructible walls and floor traps that can hinder your progress outside of the monsters themselves. This does help you gain some muscle memory and learn the best way to handle challenges from run to run, but the majority of the battles felt trivial on standard difficulty. I only got consistently challenged by the last couple of bosses, who have such large health pools that you can’t kill them so aggressively fast that they don’t even have the chance to do damage to you.","Though Yasha is pretty easy, it can still be fun thanks to the snappy combat and how different each of the three playable characters control compared to one another. Every fighter combines light and heavy attacks to vanquish foes while using dashes and parries (successful ones can be turned to big damage counter attacks) to stay alive. Shigure’s sword swinging is capable of a balance between aggressive and defensive strategies that rely on those counters, which feels very different from Sara’s all-in dual wielding style that’s all about overwhelming enemies with naturally empowered dash attacks or Taketora’s patient ranged strategy of creating distance and clobbering enemies from afar, while also having strong melee options to make space if needed. It’s all pretty basic, but it's crisp and crunchy. Like a good, oni-flavored potato chip.","The weapon selection is plentiful at around seven options per character, of which you can take any two on a trip through the dungeon. They’re all pretty different from one another, with swords that light enemies on fire or get stronger every time you use certain types of attacks… but across characters, you’ll start to notice they don’t deviate much – for example, all three warriors have a version of that fire weapon or that one that gets stronger. And when most enemies are so easy that they don’t require much strategy to beat, there wasn’t much encouragement to experiment with the more interesting weapons anyway, like a fun looking bow that can mark enemies and make every subsequent shot home in on them.","The only real randomness in Yasha comes in the various soul orb buffs you can earn for your weapons after each room of enemies that empower and alter their abilities, as well as amulets that increase your stats that you can buy from a shopkeeper or loot from enemies. The former is where almost all my brainpower was spent, trying to guess how a new ability might work in tandem with ones I already have or if it’s good enough to abandon my original plan entirely for. I spent the majority of my runs across all three warriors focusing on one specific build simply to defeat the frustrating power spike of the last boss, since many of these abilities function similarly between like weapons in each character’s arsenal. As the saying goes: if it’s broken, don’t fix it.","After every run, win or lose, you can spend currency earned in battle on some passive abilities that strengthen your damage and health or give you bonuses when certain conditions are met, like bonus attack damage while at less than half HP. Whether you choose to invest in these talents or use those resources to upgrade your favorite weapons instead, I always felt significantly stronger the next time I went down the rabbit hole. None really changed the way I played significantly, but they made everything I planned to do work a bit better than last time.","When finishing a character’s story, you gain the ability to add modifiers to future runs that ostensibly make it more difficult. This does add more push back to any given run far earlier and gives you access to special items that let you upgrade your weapons even further, but I ran out of steam on pushing myself to this game’s limits pretty quickly after the main campaigns were buttoned up. At around 21 hours across three characters, seeing the exact same areas and enemies so many times, I just couldn’t be bothered to take any more trips though the demon gate."],"translatedText":[],"imageUrl":"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/yashalegendofthedemonblade-review-blogroll-1747111070267.jpg","localImagePath":"/images/art-1747161493418-3t1pxc-article.jpg","author":"Tom Marks","pubDate":"Tue, 13 May 2025 16:00:00 +0000","postedToFacebook":false,"postedToX":false,"createdAt":"2025-05-13T18:38:13.533Z"},{"id":4,"sourceUrl":"https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc","title":"Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Is Up for Preorder, Releases September 16","originalText":["Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is set to release for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC on September 19.

It didn’t make its way to the West until 2011, when it came out here for PlayStation Portable. The game has two direct sequels, Trails in the Sky SC and Trails in the Sky the 3rd. The overarching Legend of Heroes series spans much more time, with entries releasing between the 1980s and now.","Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of the first entry in this sub-series. In it, you play as Estelle and Joshua, two Bracers-in-training who travel around the world, helping people in order to earn full Bracer status. The main overarching storyline revolves around the mystery of what happened to Estelle’s father, who has gone missing. The game is known for its many characters and many lines of dialogue. It’s sort of a relaxed, slow moving, hang-out game that verges on visual novel territory at times. It’s great.","Instead of the PS1-style sprite-based graphics of the original, this remake features full 3D anime-style graphics that look basically like the Tales or Dragon Quest games. It looks pretty great, especially since the story of the original is so good. It will be nice to experience it with a more modern presentation.

More advanced cooling designs, a more uncommon colorway, or overclocking out of the box add to the cost, but even then, admittedly, these cards are still priced higher than what Nvidia originally advertised.","The reality is that even third party manufacturers like Gigabyte, MSI, Asus (and pretty much everyone else) are also taking advantage of the high demand by marking prices up from the get-go. Unfortunately, you'd be hard pressed to find another RTX 5070 Ti GPU for this price or less. RTX 5070 Ti GPUs are generally selling for over $1,000 on eBay.","Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.","Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Review by Jacqueline Thomas","\"At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.\"","Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

Over the weekend, the team debuted a significant chunk of cards, from both the main set and the Commander decks, and fans are enjoying some of the fun and even surprising cuts from their favorite Final Fantasy games.","The Universes Beyond collaboration with Final Fantasy is getting both the usual Commander treatment and a booster-driven series, so there are a lot of cards to go over. The main set tinkers with the entirety of Final Fantasy's mainline, numbered games, running from Final Fantasy 1 to Final Fantasy 16. The Commander Decks, meanwhile, focus on four specific games: Final Fantasy 6, 7, 10, and 14, with their respective Commanders of Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.","Some of the cards shown at last Saturday's Magic: The Gathering panel at PAX East captured the journey of individual characters throughout their games. Final Fantasy IV's Cecil, for example, has an entire mechanic around transforming from a Dark Knight into a Paladin. The summons of Final Fantasy utilize a \"Saga Creature\" set-up, to act as powerful but temporary forces on the field, melding Magic and Final Fantasy concepts in the process.","Then you have cards like Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER, with artwork from Square's Tetsuya Nomura. The transformation along the card illustrates Sephiroth's various forms throughout the FF7 universe, from a young fighter into, eventually,  Safer Sephiroth on the card Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel.","And what would a Final Fantasy be without some Cids? The Final Fantasy set will include a Cid from each of the numbered Final Fantasy games, though Wizards is opting for the older Cid from Final Fantasy XV over his daughter, Cindy.","After Saturday's panel, though, Wizards of the Coast released the decklist for the four aforementioned Commander decks, and fans started poring over the art and additions to see how the team adapted those four Final Fantasy games into Magic. Pretty well, it turns out.","Reprints, or new versions of existing Magic cards, get some clever crossovers with Final Fantasy lore. Skullclamp, for instance, draws on the Jenova project in Final Fantasy 7 for its art.","Together, Forever also takes an emotional stab at the Final Fantasy 10 fans out there. It shouldn't be surprising that Final Fantasy 10 has some emotional wellsprings to draw from, with its central protagonists' journey through a ruined land, on a somber pilgrimage. Several decks' cards reference some notable character moments, by the way, so you might want to go into these decklists aware that there will be some story spoilers for each respective game.","But to lighten things up, one of Final Fantasy 10's more iconic, and frequently memed, moments also made the cut with Inspiring Call.","In fact, Wizards found more than a few ways to incorporate Final Fantasy's less-serious moments into cards. Clever Concealment puts a spin on the Wall Market scene with Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa in dresses, heading to Don Corneo's, and even has a mechanic that seems fitting for the occassion. I'm a big fan of the Secret Rendezvous card, which has four different versions of the Golden Saucer date scene from Final Fantasy 7 with each potential date: Aerith, Tifa, Yuffie, and Barret.","Even still, fans have been discovering the tiny details that show how much homage is being paid to the source material. The Final Fantasy 14 set, in particular, has quite a few references to the critically acclaimed MMORPG. The Hildibrand Manderville card mimics the infamous gentleman's habit of disappearing and returning, making for quite an interesting White/Black card in the process.","One user on the FFXIV subreddit noted that the Archaeomancer's Map card uses a real possible location found in a Gaganaskin Treasure Map, for instance.","In turn, Final Fantasy 14 players have been having fun with the cards. There are some jokes about wondering who the Thancred card represents, referencing the \"This is Thancred\" meme. And there's the alternative flavor text a user added to the Rite of Replication card, commemorating everyone's favorite speech from A Realm Reborn:","Even the Tome of Legends card depicts a Wondrous Tails book, with all the little details you see in-game when a player picks up their Tails and, of course, several missed four-in-a-row connections.","There's some clear attention to detail put into these cards, and it's certainly got me intrigued to see the full set. While the Commander games got a lot of love in these cards, a few reveals from Saturday's panel like Commune With Beavers have me eager to see how some of the other Final Fantasy games got adapated into the full Magic set.","Magic: The Gathering's Final Fantasy set is out on June 13, 2025, with pre-release weekend one week prior.","Eric is a freelance writer for IGN."],"translatedText":[],"imageUrl":"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/ignfinalfantasymtgcardslead-1747153645823.jpg","localImagePath":"/images/art-1747161492576-2ws00r-article.jpg","author":"Eric Van Allen","pubDate":"Tue, 13 May 2025 17:31:29 +0000","postedToFacebook":false,"postedToX":false,"createdAt":"2025-05-13T18:38:12.977Z"}]
